<p>Chapter 1124: Witch of the Cao Clan</p>
<p>Ten clusters of different-colored flames transformed into ferocious fire beasts that slowly rose into the sky. Various-colored glows landed on the stunned expressions of everyone below as they did so, causing the scene to appear exceptionally comical.</p>
<p>The ten types of flames along with the earlier Green Lotus Core Flame formed a total of eleven flames. Xiao Yan was able to control eleven flames with his own strength!</p>
<p>The courtyard was silent as everyone watched this shocking scene. It was a moment later before some noises from the inhalation of cold air slowly appeared…</p>
<p>Each time one controlled an additional flame, it would impose a harsh toll on one's Spiritual Strength. With Cao Dan's ability, he was at the most able to control four types of flames. Moreover, this had already allowed him to reach the point where he could hardly find any opponent within the Cao clan, yet the current Xiao Yan allowed him to understand what was meant by there was always someone better out there…</p>
<br>
<br><p>Eleven types of flames. Even if Cao Dan were to use all of his Spiritual Strength, it was likely that he would be unable to completely control them, much less transforming them into beast forms to fight with others.</p>
<p>Fierce flames rose into the air. The high temperature that spread down caused Cao Dan's mouth to dry. His already somewhat pale face became even paler. Xiao Yan's ability was a very big blow to him.</p>
<p>"How is it possible?"</p>
<p>Cao Dan softly muttered in his mouth. His eyes were filled with disbelief. Xiao Yan appeared much younger than him. How was it possible for him to control eleven types of flames? This level was something that even his sister, who was regarded as a witch in his clan, was unable to do…</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p>
<p>Cao Dan's eyes had become much redder after he muttered that word. He appeared just like a gambling addict about to lose all of his fortune. He let out a furious roar as a thought passed through his heart. The four fire beasts in the sky emitted low, deep roars as they charged at Xiao Yan's multicolored fire beasts.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan watched Cao Dan, who was going all out, with an indifferent expression. The corner of his mouth was lifted into a cold smile. He randomly waved his sleeves and the eleven fire beasts in the sky appeared like ferocious tigers descending from a mountain as they collided with Cao Dan's four fire beasts. After which, they began to tear and bite at each other in a crazy manner. Clusters of flames continued to scatter…</p>
<p>Cao Dan's four fire beasts descended into an outnumbered situation in the face of Xiao Yan's terrifying numbers. They did not endure for long before the flames on their bodies were gradually torn apart. After which, they slowly disappeared one after another in front of the many eyes in the front yard…</p>
<p>By the time Cao Dan's last fire beas disappeared, nine out of eleven fire beasts belonging to Xiao Yan still survived…</p>
<p>Cao Dan's body shook when the final fire beast disappeared. His feet immediately took two steps back in panic. A groan was emitted from his throat at the same time. Those fire beasts contained some of his remnant Spiritual Strength. Hence, the disappearance of those fire beasts caused some damage to his Spiritual Strength.</p>
<p>Cao Dan, who was pulling back, was hurriedly supported by the two elders behind him. His eyes stared at the nine fire beasts in the sky, and his face alternated between white and green. He had never expected the bet, he had thought he was going to win, would end up with him being defeated in such a miserable manner by Xiao Yan.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan glanced at Cao Dan. He widened his mouth and the fire wolf transformed into a wisp of green-colored flames. The flame shot down before entering Xiao Yan's mouth. Those eight other fire beasts gradually turned into nothing within a short moment…</p>
<p>These flames, that had yet to be refined into a flame seed, could only be used once. After a single usage, they would scatter if the energy within them was not replenished.</p>
<p>"Young master Cao Dan, please leave…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan withdrew the Green Lotus Core Flame. His expression was much better when compared to Cao Dan. He had practiced the Flame Creation Skill and was extremely familiar with flame manipulation. Moreover, the strength of his Spiritual Strength was far from what the likes of Cao Dan could compare with.</p>
<p>Cao Dan's expression became much uglier when he heard his command. He had lost to Xiao Yan in front of so many people. Moreover, he had lost in flame manipulation, his specialization This was undoubtedly equivalent to giving him a ruthless slap.</p>
<p>"Alright… no wonder Ye Zhong would place his hopes on you. You do indeed possess some skill. I have underestimated you…" Cao Dan inhaled a couple of breaths of deep air. He suppressed the fury, that arose from embarrassment, rising in his heart as he spoke in a dark voice.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled. Cao Dan might say that he was a tier 7 alchemist, but from the way Xiao Yan saw it, Cao Dan would, at the very most, be at the low grade seventh tier. He could not be considered a great opponent. It would not be troublesome if Xiao Yan were to meet him at the Pill Gathering in the future… </p>
<p>"I have lost today. Rest assured that I will keep my word. My Cao clan will not come and find trouble for a period of time…" Cao Dan's dark and ferocious eyes suddenly turned to Ye Zhong's group after he spoke. He then continued in a dense, cold manner, "However, it is merely the ravings of a lunatic if your Ye clan wishes to regain an Elder's Seat. My Cao clan will be unwilling to see such a thing occurring. There is still less than a month before the test begins. I want to see whether your Ye clan can rely on him to squeeze into the top three spots!"</p>
<p>Ye Zhong's expression slightly changed. He coldly said, "There is no need for you to worry about this matter on behalf of the Ye clan."</p>
<p>Cao Dan frostily smiled. His gaze immediately swung to Xiao Yan as he said, "Xiao Yan, you are indeed very strong. However, I believe sooner or later, you will end up regretting offending the Cao clan!"</p>
<p>"Have you finished saying all that you need to? If you have, please…" Xiao Yan crossed his fingers and faintly commanded without giving Cao Dan an additional look.</p>
<p>Cao Dan was filled with fury because of Xiao Yan's indifferent attitude. If two elite Dou Zuns were not backing Xiao Yan up, it was likely that he would be unable to control himself and get Ku Yi zun-zhe to attack, giving this hateful fellow a vicious lesson.</p>
<p>"You are an alchemist. I think that you will also participate in the Pill Gathering. At that time, there will naturally be someone from my Cao clan who will take care of you… let's go!"</p>
<p>Cao Dan's eyes glared at Xiao Yan in a dangerous manner. A moment later, he tossed out some ruthless words before suddenly turning around. With a wave of his hand, he left this yard with a great unwillingness while carrying a body filled with fury. All the experts from the Cao clan behind him faced each other before letting out a quiet sigh and hurriedly followed.</p>
<p>The members of the Ye clan sighed in relief when they saw the people from the Cao clan leaving in a dispirited manner. Cheers sounded as a result. The respect in their eyes as they looked at Xiao Yan also became more prevalent.</p>
<p>"Big brother Xiao Yan, thank you!" Xin Lan sighed in relief in her heart. Her pretty eyes looked at Xiao Yan as she spoke with some joy.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and said, "Since I have promised you, I will protect the Ye clan. At the very least, until I have fulfilled my promise…"</p>
<p>"Mister Xiao Yan, everyone in the Ye clan will never forget the great favors you have done for the Ye clan. Please feel free to ask if there is anything you need my Ye clan to do in the future. Even though there are some things that we are unable to do, my Ye clan will try its best!" Ye Zhong cupped his hands together and bowed to Xiao Yan as he spoke in an unusually serious manner.</p>
<p>"I am unworthy of such a solemn and respectful ceremony from Elder Ye Zhong. Please do not continue." Xiao Yan slightly leaned his body forward as he replied with a smile.</p>
<p>Ye Zhong smiled when he heard his words. His eyes wandered in the direction Cao Dan had disappeared. However, there was some worry in his eyes as he sighed, "From the words that Cao Dan uttered earlier, I think that that witch from the Cao clan has likely returned…"</p>
<p>"Witch?" Xiao Yan raised his head upon hearing this, feeling a little uncertain as he did so.</p>
<p>Ye Zhong bitterly laughed when he saw Xiao Yan's uncertainty. He asked, "Mister Xiao Yan, what do you think of Cao Dan?"</p>
<p>"His character is nothing great, but he does have some skill in terms of flame control. Moreover, he is able to reach the level of a tier 7 alchemist at such a young age. His talent is worthy of being described as a genius…" Xiao Yan voiced his thoughts. Although Cao Dan was arrogant, he did possess decent ability.</p>
<p>"This Cao Dan is unable to show even the slightest bit of arrogance in front of the witch of the Cao clan…" Ye Zhong softly explained. His tone contained an exceptional bitterness. If his Ye clan could produce such a person, would he still need to worry about their strength? This kind of witch was a terrifying character where she alone could be relied on to support the entire clan.</p>
<p>"Oh?" surprise flashed across his eyes. The Cao clan had such a person?</p>
<p>"This witch is called Cao Ying. Her entire life has been filled with a legendary hue. When she was born, she already displayed a Spiritual Strength that shocked others. Her mother was nearly killed by the Spiritual Strength that spread from her. When she was seven years old, she had formally become an alchemist. At fifteen, she caught the eye of the Pill Tower and an exception was made to take her in as core disciple of the Pill Tower. She has trained quietly in the Pill Tower for five years. At twenty, she became the youngest tier 7 alchemist in the Cao clan. Currently, she is twenty-two…" Ye Zhong's soft voice lingered over the yard, causing all the members of the Ye clan to lower their heads in shame upon hearing this. Compared to Cao Ying, they were merely useless people just waiting to die…</p>
<p>Of course, they were not the only ones who reacted like this. Even Xiao Yan's face displayed a solemn expression. The Central Plains region was indeed filled with many hidden talents. If the reason he possessed the current achievement was due to a combination of both talent and effort, this Cao Ying was likely really a little witch blessed by the Heavens… </p>
<p>"Reaching tier 7 at twenty years old. During these two years, she would definitely have advanced. I guess the current her…" Ye Zhong paused when he spoke until this point. His face was filled with bitterness, "The current her should be at least at the peak of the tier 7 level…"</p>
<p>The entire yard was completely silent. A twenty-two-year-old peak tier 7 alchemist. This achievement would likely enter the top ten even when compared with the thousand years of alchemist history.</p>
<p>"Cao Ying will definitely participate in this Pill Gathering. According to tradition, if one wishes to slowly advance to be one of the giant heads of the Pill Tower, one must be the champion of a Pill Gathering…" Ye Zhong sighed. "This Cao Ying is quite ambitious. Therefore, she will definitely not give up this Pill Gathering."</p>
<p>Ye Zhong's eyes turned to the grave face of Xiao Yan and slowly said, "This girl will be a great opponent of yours in the Pill Gathering!"</p>
<p>Chapter 1125: Pressure</p>
<p>Xiao Yan's expression was solemn as he nodded. If this Cao Ying really possessed a relaxed character, it was likely that he would not like this kind of life while being on a high position…</p>
<p>"Ke ke, but mister Xiao Yan need not be too afraid. That Cao Ying might be strong, but if you were to compete with each other, no one will know just who will come out on top as long as she has yet to reach tier 8. Unless she has reached this level, there is no guaranteed victory. Refining medicinal pills occasionally relies on one's condition and luck. Everyone will meet with failure…" Ye Zhong hurriedly laughed. He thought that Xiao Yan was worried after seeing him descend into silence. </p>
<p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. Tier 8 and tier 7 were two completely different concept. After all these years, it was likely that the only alchemist he had met who could refine a tier 8 medicinal pill was Yao Lao alone… </p>
<p>Xiao Yan had met some tier 7 alchemists after having arrived in the Central Plains region. However, he had never met a tier 8 alchemist. It was likely that even some Dou Zun class experts would need to be extremely courteous to an alchemist of this tier. They would possess a position that was similar to the height Yao Lao reached in the Central Plains back then.</p>
<p>The reason why there were so few tier 8 alchemists clearly indicated how difficult it was to advance to this level. A tier 7 alchemist might be able to do extremely well in the Central Plains. However, if one wanted to reach the point where even an elite Dou Zun would willingly come to be your fighter, one would, at the very least, need to reach the eighth tier… </p>
<p>Xiao Yan withdrew from the thoughts within his heart as he smiled and said, "Relax, I will definitely do well in this Pill Gathering. I will do my best regardless of how strong the opponents are…"</p>
<p>Ye Zhong grinned and nodded upon hearing his reply. He said, "Mister Xiao Yan. The test of the five great clans will begin in less than one month's time. We still need to leave for Holy Pill City in advance. Therefore, we must leave in around twenty days."</p>
<p>This pressing schedule caused Xiao Yan to frown. Immediately, he nodded. He was currently pressed for time, and he could no longer waste any. However, it was fortunate that his pill refinement training had gradually progressed well. Although he had yet to successfully refine a tier 7 high rank medicinal pill, his chances of success when refining some low and middle grade medicinal pills had significantly raised. With this speed, Xiao Yan sooner or later would be able to successfully refine a tier 7 high rank medicinal pill.</p>
<p>"All you need to do is inform me before you leave. I will rest for one day before continuing my retreat and practicing hard for a period of time…"</p>
<p>Even Ye Zhong involuntarily wiped some cold sweat off his face when he heard that Xiao Yan was going to continue his tortuous training. Pill refinement was an extremely tiring and troublesome matter. Based on common sense, it was impossible for even a tier 7 alchemist to refine pills all day long. After all, this was really too exhausting.</p>
<p>This was originally the case based on common sense. However, Xiao Yan had not only been born with a powerful Spiritual Strength but he also had the help of a Heavenly Flame. This enabled him conserve his stamina when refining pills. Hence, if other tier 7 alchemists could at the very most refine three medicinal pills per day, Xiao Yan would be able to refine six, ten, or many more times the amount they could!</p>
<p>In other words, his one day spent in bitter training was equivalent to training a couple of days by others. Of course, this kind of wild, uncontrolled training was extremely harsh. However, Xiao Yan had suffered many hardships during these years. He might not have anything else, but his character was tough after being honed all these years… </p>
<p>The achievement that Xiao Yan possessed today was definitely not something that he had suddenly obtained!</p>
<p>Ye Zhong felt some admiration for Xiao Yan after wiping off his cold sweat. He said in a solemn voice, "Ugh, mister Xiao Yan, please continue to train with peace of mind. You can just inform the old me if you do not have enough medicinal ingredients. Even if I have to exhaust the entire collection of my Ye clan, I will definitely support mister Xiao Yan until you have completed your training!"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. He once again chatted with Ye Zhong about some matters related to the Pill Gathering before returning to his own room while the others returned to theirs… </p>
<p>Xiao Yan once again entered the Pill Refinement Room on the second day after having resolved the trouble that came with the Cao clan. After which, he announced that he would undertake a retreat to engage in harsh training. Soon after, an endless amount of rare medicinal ingredients were carried out of Ye clan's warehouse, and they were piled in the Pill Refinement Room…</p>
<p>Due to Xiao Yan having stepped forward, the Ye clan was temporarily no longer faced with any disturbances from the Cao clan. Additionally, the Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe would occasionally show themselves. This caused the factions coveting the Ye clan to hold back a little. Two elite Dou Zuns, this lineup was definitely not something an ordinary faction could contend with.</p>
<p>Without the trouble that came from the outside world, the Ye clan became much quieter. Time gradually flowed by amid silence, appearing just like the sand seeping between one's fingers…</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to the approaching Pill Gathering, but the entire Pill Region became unusually lively. Almost every part of the Pill Region was experiencing traffic that was larger than usual. Moreover, some more observant individuals would discover that various alchemists of different ascents from various places were beginning to appear within the Pill Region one after another. Clearly, these people were here because of the Pill Gathering…</p>
<p>The Pill Gathering was not only a grand event in the alchemists world, but it was also a grand event for the Central Plains. Each time the Pill Gathering began, the Pill Region would become the focal point of the entire Central Plains region and sometimes even the continent. Countless numbers of people or factions would swarm over like hungry wolves who had smelled the fragrance of flesh…</p>
<p>An alchemist was the most respected occupation in the Dou Qi continent. Everyone was envious of an alchemists' abilities. Some alchemists might not be strong when it came to combat strength. However, that alchemist only needed to take out a small medicinal pill in order to get experts to fight on his or her behalf and take the other party's life…</p>
<p>Hence, everyone on the continent knew that it was best to avoid offending an alchemist, especially a high tier alchemist. This was because these people were like a beehive. The moment one touched a high tier alchemist, one would end up inviting an endless amount of trouble.</p>
<p>A high tier alchemist was also someone some factions wanted the most. In order to get one of them under their wings, many factions would issue attractive offers. There were even some factions who would end up fighting until blood flowed like a river in order to snatch a high tier alchemist… </p>
<p>The distinguished position of alchemists caused the Pill Gathering to be an exceptionally important occasion. Everyone knew that this kind of gathering would attract talented alchemists from across the continent. Those who could stand out among them definitely possessed a great strength. As long as a faction managed to recruit one of these alchemists, it would undoubtedly mean that their strength would rapidly soar…</p>
<p>These were the reasons why so many people were coming to the Pill Region. Moreover, with the flow of time, this extremely vast Pill Region would likely fill with even more people who had come after hearing about the Pill Gathering…</p>
<p>While the human traffic within the Pill Region was beginning to soar, the time of the five great clans' test also approached…</p>
<p>Everyone from the Ye clan respectfully stood outside of a Pill Refinement Room in the deepest parts of the Ye clan. The ones standing at the front were Ye Zhong, Xin Lan, and the few Ye clan's Elders.</p>
<p>Today was the last day before they would begin traveling to the Holy Pill City. It was also the day that Xiao Yan would finish his retreat…</p>
<p>Xiao Yan did not even take half a step out of the Pill Refinement Room during these twenty something days. The hot environment within the Pill Refinement Room caused even some of the members of the Ye clan, who had delivered medicinal ingredients, to be afraid of staying for long. Usually, they would gently place the medicinal ingredients down before hurriedly withdrawing in silence… </p>
<p>Dark clouds would frequently gather in the sky near the backyard of the Ye clan during these twenty odd days. There was even some lightning gathering within the dark clouds a couple of times. However, the clouds would suddenly scatter just when a bolt of lightning was about to descend…</p>
<p>This kind of change in the sky naturally attracted the attention of Ye Zhong and the rest. All of their hearts were a little shaken. They could clearly sense the surging energy ripple emitted from the sealed Pill Refining Room when the Pill Lightning was about to descend. This kind of energy ripple was extremely similar to the situation that appeared when some tier 7 high grade medicinal pill were about to take shape…</p>
<p>Although they did not know why the surging energy ripple would suddenly disappear every time it reached a critical moment, all of them understood that this was something done on purpose by Xiao Yan…</p>
<p>Regardless of Xiao Yan's intentions, they were able to vaguely understand something. This period of bitter training seemed to have improved Xiao Yan's pill refinement skill…</p>
<p>"Creak creak…"</p>
<p>While various thoughts quietly lingered in the hearts of Ye Zhong's group, the tightly shut stone door was slowly opened. A great amount of heat immediately spread out from within…</p>
<p>A skinny figure slowly walked out as the temperature rose. A moment later, he appeared in front of everyone's line of sight.</p>
<p>The skinny figure's clothes were a little messy. His black hair was scattered around his head, and his face possessed a sparse beard. He looked quite miserable. Nevertheless, his dark-black eyes were unusually bright.</p>
<p>For some unknown reason, Ye Zhong's group vaguely felt that Xiao Yan was a little different from before, especially as they watched him walk out of the Pill Refinement Room…</p>
<p>Chapter 1126: Spiritual States</p>
<p>This kind of change was not obvious, but it gave Ye Zhong's group a kind of strange feeling. It appeared as though Xiao Yan, who was in front of them, had become more dazzling than before he had undertaken the retreat.</p>
<p>The Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe were also a little startled because of this change. The Little Fairy Doctor was still fine but Tian Huo zun-zhe seemed to have fallen deep into thought…</p>
<p>Xiao Yan was a little surprised upon seeing so many people outside the door after he walked out of the training room. He helplessly shook his head and questioned, "Elder Ye Zhong, there is no need for such grandness, is there?"</p>
<p>"Ke ke…" Ye Zhong hurriedly recovered upon hearing his words. He laughed before waving his hand and scattering the clan members who had gathered here. With a smile, he said, "Mister Xiao Yan. We will begin our journey to the Holy Pill City tomorrow. Are you prepared?"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan nodded. It was unexpected that time had passed so quickly during his retreat. Nearly a month had passed within the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>"Mister Xiao Yan, nothing is wrong with you, is there?" Ye Zhong glanced at Xiao Yan. He seemed to vaguely sense a kind of faint pressure when he was close to Xiao Yan. This kind of pressure seemed originate from deep within his soul, causing him to find it difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan revealed an uncertain expression in the face of Ye Zhong's question. He frowned and asked, "What can happen to me?"</p>
<p>From the way Xiao Yan acted, it seemed he was unaware of the slight change.</p>
<p>Ye Zhong was somewhat stunned when he saw Xiao Yan's lost manner. Could it be that he was mistaken?</p>
<p>"It is not that you are mistaken. This fellow's Spiritual Strength seems to have risen during this retreat…" Tian Huo zun-zhe finally shifted his eyes away from Xiao Yan. He smiled as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Spiritual Strength?"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan was stunned when he heard this. He immediately fondled his chin and mused, "Now that you mention it, I seem to have suddenly found it much easier to refine pills when compared to before. Moreover, my control over the flame has become even more exquisite as well… however, can't Spiritual Strength only be grow when one's level increases? My strength is currently still at the level of a four star Dou Zong. It is only a little more stable compared to when I had just advanced to it…"</p>
<p>Tian Huo zun-zhe glanced at Xiao Yan with a strange expression. A moment later, he finally raised his eyebrows and said, "Looks like that teacher of yours did not inform you about matters relating to Spiritual Strength… but this is only natural. An ordinary person can only bend according to this exceedingly mysterious thing known as the the soul. They cannot control it. Even the you previous only knew how to control your Spiritual Strength, but you do not have a deep understanding of it…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan and Ye Zhong feel pondered Tian Huo zun-zhe's words. Xiao Yan came to a sudden but complete understanding while Ye Zhong continued frowning. This argument was something that he had seen in some of the ancient books in the clan.</p>
<p>"Spiritual Strength does not have a difference in grade but it possesses a difference in state…"</p>
<p>Tian Huo zun-zhe faintly smiled and explained, "Of course, very few people these days have heard this statement because this kind of Spiritual State is something that most experts cannot touch over their entire lives. Do you know why so many alchemists have remained at the seventh tier all their lives? It is because of this Spiritual State…"</p>
<p>"Spiritual State…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan frowned. He had really never heard of this thing. However, the soul is the source of life. Nothing will exist without the soul. If one's soul was not destroyed, one would still possess a thread of life. Anyone would maintain a healthy respect for this kind of mysterious thing.</p>
<p>However, Xiao Yan only knew that his Spiritual Strength was quite strong. He understood little else. Moreover, Xiao Yan had only reached the level of a tier 5 alchemist back when Yao Lao was captured. At that time, he was unqualified to learn about whatever Spiritual State. He had lacked the teaching of Yao Lao during these few years, causing him to be completely unaware of some of the information related to peak level alchemists. This so-called Spiritual State was one of those things…</p>
<p>"What I have said is likely something that only alchemist grandmasters who have reached the eighth tier know. Otherwise, one could only find information in some ancient books…" Tian Huo zun-zhe slowly explained. If he had not been from this era, it was likely that he would have been unable to provide Xiao Yan with an explanation.</p>
<p>"The Spiritual States are divided into four levels. The Mortal State, Soul State, Heavenly State, and Di (God) State… most people, even alchemists who are below the eighth tier, remain at the Mortal State. There is only slight variations in might between most people's Spiritual Strengths. In the past, you were at this level but just much stronger than an ordinary person…</p>
<p>"With luck, some tier 7 alchemists may be able to vaguely touch the Soul State. If a person's Spiritual Strength has reached this level, it will gain a certain effect. That effect is to endow a soul, providing a medicinal pill with spirituality… you should be aware that most tier 8 medicinal pills possess a spirituality. It is due to this spirituality that enables them to reach the eighth tier. Regardless of how outstanding the pill refinement Technique of an ordinary alchemist is, the medicinal pill that they create will never reach the eighth tier if they are unable to provide the pill with a spirit…</p>
<p>"Heavenly State, you should be aware that when it comes to a tier 9 medicinal pill, its intelligence will not be any different from an ordinary person. This is equivalent to a kind of creation, the creation of life. One must not only provide it with spirituality, but one must also have the might of nature. In order to achieve this, one would need to reach the almighty Heavenly State. It is likely that very few people on this continent can achieve this level…</p>
<p>"As for the Di State… this only exists in legends. Even I have only heard of it. However, I think you should be aware of the top tier of the Spiritual States… Di (God) tier. All that I can tell you is that this state is related to the Di tier medicinal pill. The Di tier medicinal pill… is related to the legendary Dou Di.</p>
<p>"However, it is not known just how many people have failed to reach this state…"</p>
<p>Tian Huo zun-zhe's voice was regretful when he finished speaking. However, Xiao Yan's group was no longer able to sense the regret in his voice. The few of them had been shaken into a giddy state by the words Tian Huo zun-zhe had uttered.</p>
<p>Other than Ye Zhong, who had some vague memory of Spiritual States, everyone else, even The Little Fairy Doctor, felt a little lost. She had just advanced to the Dou Zun class. In terms of experience, she was unable to compete with an old demon like Tian Huo zun-zhe.</p>
<p>"This… it seems that I have also read these theories in some ancient books. However, they did not describe it in such detail like old mister Yao. When I saw them back then, I thought that they were merely a fallacy and did not pay much attention to them…" Ye Zhong finally recovered after a while. He spoke in a somewhat vexed manner. "My Ye clan ancestor was also a tier 8 alchemist back then. However, he did not leave behind any information regarding Spiritual States…"</p>
<p>"The soul is an extremely mysterious existence. Some alchemists would be at a complete loss even if they broke through because of a lucky opportunity…" Tian Huo zun-zhe glanced at Xiao Yan and said, "The previous you did not have the qualification to come into contact with this information. I originally thought that your teacher would have told you about it. However, seeing your appearance, it seems that I inferred poorly…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan bitterly laughed and explained, "I was merely a tier 5 alchemist when teacher fell into the hands of the Hall of Souls. How could I come into contact with such information…"</p>
<p>"Your current Spiritual State seems to have touched the Soul State. When you can enter the Soul State will depend on how blessed you are… it is rumored that there was a special training method for training one's spirit during the ancient times. It is called Soul Technique. However, it has clearly been lost because even I have never seen anything about the so-called Soul Technique…" Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed.</p>
<p>"The spirit can be trained?" Xiao Yan immediately cried out in surprise upon hearing this. His face was filled with disbelief. On the current Dou Qi continent, one's soul could only be strengthened along with the increase of one's might. Alternatively, one could consume some natural treasures, but being able to train it through a training method was something that Xiao Yan had never heard of.</p>
<p>"I have already said that it was during the ancient times…" Tian Huo zun-zhe rolled his eyes as he replied.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and shook his head upon seeing him roll his eyes. Training one's spirit. This was really a little too unbelievable. Xiao Yan was not too interested in whatever Soul State. His crazy pill refinement during his retreat had caused his head to remain in a semi-conscious state, which resulted in some tier 7 high grade medicinal pills failing despite having a chance to succeed. However, he felt that something was not quite right now that he thought of it. He had clearly sensed that he had become a little more familiar with refining tier 7 high grade medicinal pill… </p>
<p>"Looks like I will need to find an opportunity to study it properly in the future. If I wish to advance into the eighth tier, I will need to comprehend these so-called Spiritual States…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan mused in his heart. Tian Huo zun-zhe's words had undoubtedly opened a new world for him to explore. Only now did he understand that the soul was related to the advancement beyond that of a tier 7 alchemist…</p>
<p>"No wonder there are so many tier 7 alchemists while tier 8 alchemists are so rare… it is likely that some tier 7 alchemists are not aware of the so-called Spiritual States."</p>
<p>"However, it would be best if I am able to obtain a kind of Soul Technique that enables me to train my soul. With this thing, I should be able to advance to the Soul State in a much smoother manner. Unfortunately… it has already been lost…" Xiao Yan's heart was filled with regret when he thought about this. The loss of these Soul Techniques might be the main reason why the current generation of alchemists had difficulty advancing to the eighth tier.</p>
<p>"I wonder if the Pill Tower possesses a Soul Technique? By being able to become the holy ground in the hearts of a countless number of alchemists, it is likely not an ordinary place. Hopefully, I will be able to obtain some news regarding a Soul Technique on my trip to the Holy Pill City. Who knows when this kind of thing will appear…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan sighed. He had made up his mind. During this trip of his to the Holy Pill City, finding a Soul Technique would be an important task!</p>
<p>Chapter 1127: Hurrying to Holy Pill City!</p>
<p>All the members of the Ye clan were standing at the entrance of the manor the next day. Their eyes were searing hot as they watched Xiao Yan's group in front of them. Whether the Ye clan would be able to gain a Pill Tower's Elder's Seat would depend on Xiao Yan's placement in the five great clan's test…</p>
<p>The Ye clan would only be considered to have been elevated if Xiao Yan successfully enters the top three. With the protection of the Pill Tower, they would be able to develop in peace. Although they would definitely be unable to surpass a clan like the Cao clan within a short period of time, they would, at the very least, possess the ability to protect themselves. The Ye clan might end up producing a genius of the younger generation like that witch Cao Ying from the Cao clan. Then the Ye clan would be able to gradually rise and regain its former glory.</p>
<p>"Second Elder, third Elder, I will follow mister Xiao Yan and the rest and head to the Holy Pill City. Therefore, I will leave this Ye clan to you…" Ye Zhong spoke in a deep voice to the two elders in front of the members of the Ye clan.</p>
<p>"Yes, First Elder remain at ease and get ready for the Holy Pill City. Although our Ye clan has declined, we still have some relationships with the Pill Tower…" An elder from the Ye clan spoke. The few elders from the Ye clan beside him nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Ye Zhong sighed and nodded. With the continuous decline of the current Ye clan, some of their past relationships had been lost. However, it was fortunate that not everyone was as ruthless as the Cao clan. Moreover, it was due to these relationship that the Ye clan was still able to barely hold onto its name and have a chance to survive despite having failed the previous two tests… </p>
<p>Xiao Yan glanced at the sky and softly said, "It is already almost time. Elder Ye Zhong, let's leave…"</p>
<p>After a night of rest, the dazzling feeling that Xiao Yan had displayed yesterday had gradually been withdrawn. However, he vaguely understood that his current Spiritual Strength was a little different from what it had been in the past. If one had to give an explanation, it would be that his current Spiritual Strength had an additional soul aura about it…</p>
<p>The four great states of a soul seemed to be of some use to an alchemist. Moreover, the training of Dou Qi did not appear to be much help based on Xiao Yan's senses… </p>
<p>The training of one's soul and the training of one's Dou Qi were two completely different methods. Perhaps there were two types of training methods in the ancient times. However, across the Dou Qi continent now, the training of one's Dou Qi was considered to be the orthodox path. The soul was something that not only Xiao Yan but even some elite Dou Zuns did not understand how to strengthen through training… </p>
<p>Ye Zhong smiled and nodded upon hearing Xiao Yan's voice. After which, he ceased remaining any longer. He turned around and swiftly walked to a plaza located in the northern part of the city. There was a Wormhole located in Ye city. It was not very large, and it was unable to reach Holy Pill City. Instead, they needed to make quite a few transfers along the way in order to reach their final destination… </p>
<p>Other than Xiao Yan, the Little Fairy Doctor, and Tian Huo zun-zhe, only Xin Lan and Ye Zhong from the Ye clan were part of their group. After all, it was pointless for more people to go when it came to such a matter. It was better for them to remain in Ye city to protect the clan…</p>
<p>The few of them followed Ye Zhong as they traversed the city. Around ten minutes later, they appeared in an open ground in the north. Although the Ye clan had declined, an elderly tiger did not lose its might despite being skinny. Hence, this Wormhole that others coveted still belonged to the Ye clan.</p>
<p>Clearly, Ye Zhong had already given instructions regarding their travelling through the Wormhole. Hence, open ground was empty when they entered. Xiao Yan's group climbed up the stone stairs, and a slowly rotating Wormhole appeared in front of everyone's eyes.</p>
<p>This Wormhole of Ye city appeared to possess a grand feeling. However, from the looks of the little chaotic spatial ripple slowly being emitted from the Wormhole, it seemed that this Wormhole had not been maintained for many years…</p>
<p>"Ugh, back when my Ye clan was still at its glorious peak, there were two elite Dou Zuns who were willing to maintain the wormhole. However, with the decline of my Ye clan, we no longer have the ability to get help from an expert of this level. It is really embarrassing…" Ye Zhong bitterly laughed. He lamented as he looked at this Wormhole.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He said, "It's fine. Once we return from this trip, I will get the Little Fairy Doctor and old mister Yao to help you maintain it…"</p>
<p>"In that case, I will thank the three of you… let's get moving…"</p>
<p>Ye Zhong nodded with some gratitude. After which, he took out a somewhat complicated-looking, small, black boat from his Storage Ring. His hand rubbed it before he gently stepped forward. After which, he walked into the slowly rotating black Wormhole. Xiao Yan and the others followed close behind.</p>
<p>Xiao Yan's group appeared within the quiet spatial tunnel. Ye Zhong tossed small black coloured boat, and it soared with the wind, transforming into an enormous boat. This Space Boat was the most luxurious boat Xiao Yan had ever seen since he had entered the Central Plains. From the looks of it, this Ye Zhong had really spent a lot to obtain it.</p>
<p>The few human figures leaped onto the enormous boat. After which, Ye Zhong rubbed over the front of the boat in a familiar manner. A circular energy light barrier spread over, wrapping the boat within it. Immediately, the boat shook and suddenly increased its speed. With a 'swoosh' sound, it flew through the seemingly endless Wormhole…</p>
<p>"Ye city does not possess a Wormhole that leads directly to the Holy Pill City. Hence, we can only head to a city called Qingling City. The Wormhole from that city can reach the Holy Pill City…" Ye Zhong turned and spoke with a smile to Xiao Yan's group on the boat. It requires three days to reach Qingling City from this place, and it will take around four days from Qingling City to the Holy Pill City. Therefore, we will reach the Holy Pill City in about seven or eight days. All of you should rest in the boat during this period. There are individual rooms within the boat. Leave the matter of controlling the Space Boat to Xin Lan and I…"</p>
<p>Xiao Yan's group did not say anything in regards to Ye Zhong's suggestion. After chatting for awhile, they entered the cabin and found their own rooms… </p>
<p>Journeying through the Wormhole was bitter and quiet. However, it did not trouble Xiao Yan's group, who were used to lonely training. Xiao Yan had remained in his own room during the few day's journey, studying his Spiritual Strength. After listening to what Tian Huo zun-zhe had said yesterday, Xiao Yan had become more curious about the soul… </p>
<p>However, this examination did not produce any results. Xiao Yan had difficulty sensing the mysterious condition he had entered while refining pills a couple of days ago. However, one good thing was that Xiao Yan could sense an improvement in the medicinal pills he refined now compared to before. He knew that this improvement should be related to his soul. Although his entry into that state back then did not allow Xiao Yan's soul to completely advance to the soul state, it had, at the very least, enabled his spirit to gain an additional soul aura when compared with an ordinary mortal state.</p>
<p>Hence, the quality of some of the medicinal pills he had refined was even better than before…</p>
<p>Xiao Yan sank into his soul during the few days of travel through the Wormhole. The days swiftly passed by. Only when they were about to exit the Wormhole did Xiao Yan return from this condition… </p>
<p>The group safely arrived at Qingling City. After a brief rest, they continued their non-stop travel to the Wormhole of Qingling City and rushed to the Holy Pill City from there!</p>
<p>Xiao Yan finally witnessed the terrifying allure of the Pill Gathering while traveling through Qingling City. Various alchemists had been all over the streets, dazzling his eyes. It was the first time he had seen alchemists in such numbers. Even the Alchemist Grand Meeting held in the Jia Ma Empire was far from able to compete with the alchemists in this Qingling City regardless of quality or quantity… </p>
<p>Moreover, this was merely just a city within the Pill Region. It was really difficult to guess just how terrifying the human traffic would be when all the alchemists gathered in the Holy Pill City…</p>
<p>Xiao Yan's heart suddenly became fiery hot when he thought of the grand scene of tens of thousands of flames rising, tens of thousands of cauldron falling, and tens of thousands pills being born. Even his blood had begun to boil at this moment. If one did not witness such a scene even once in one's life, it would indeed be a regretful thing!</p>
<p>The Pill Gathering was the grandest gathering in the alchemist world. The ultimate aim of a countless number of alchemists was to stand out in the Pill Gathering. In order to achieve this, they had put in years of effort and perspiration.</p>
<p>Participating in the Pill Gathering was equivalent to obtaining the qualification to compete with the elites on the continent!</p>
<p>This was a type of acknowledgement of one's strength!</p>
<p>Who would be the greatest as the flames in tens of thousands of cauldrons simultaneously rose?</p>
<p>Xiao Yan's group's blood was boiling from excitement as they accompanied the slow and long line of humans entering the dark-black Wormhole…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The interior of the Wormhole was as dull as ever. However, it was no longer quiet. Countless numbers of Space Boats were rushing through this spacious spatial tunnel. Noise filled the spatial tunnel as they moved… </p>
<p>The legendary Holy Pill City became closer amid this noise…</p>
<p>After four days of continuous traveling, a circular, silver glow vaguely appeared in the distance of the Wormhole. This glow emitted a shocking spatial ripple…</p>
<p>The noise emitted from the many Space Boats suddenly and strangely became completely silent as everyone approached the silver-colored circle made of light. Numerous human figures in alchemist robes walked out of rooms within the Space Boats. Their eyes contained a wild heat as they stared at the silver-colored light circle… </p>
<p>Holy Pill City, the holy ground in every alchemist's heart!</p>
<p>Xiao Yan placed his hands behind him. His eyes were focused on the silver light circle in the distance. The blood flowing within his body quietly began to boil again at this moment…</p>
<p>Holy Pill City, Pill Tower… </p>
<p>I, Xiao Yan, have arrived…</p> </div>
